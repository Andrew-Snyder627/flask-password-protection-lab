# Password Protection Lab

## Introduction

We're going to make a Flask app that covers a simple authentication flow: users
can create accounts, log in, and log out.

## Tools & Resources

- [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/flask-password-protection-lab)
- [Flask-Bcrypt](https://flask-bcrypt.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.1/)

## Set Up

There is some starter code in place for a Flask API backend and a React frontend.
To get set up, run:

```console
$ pipenv install && pipenv shell
$ npm install --prefix client
$ cd server
$ flask db upgrade head
```

You can work on this lab by running the tests with `pytest -x`. It will also be
helpful to see what's happening during the request/response cycle by running the
app in the browser. You can run the Flask server with:

```console
$ python app.py
```

And you can run React in another terminal with:

```console
$ npm start --prefix client
```

You don't have to make any changes to the React code to get this lab working.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Define the Problem

Our app has three pages:

1. A signup page, where the user enters their username, password, and password
   confirmation.
2. A login page, where the user submits their username and password and are then
   logged in.
3. A user homepage, which says, "Welcome, ${username}!"

Users should not be able to log in if they enter an incorrect password.

> **Note: we're not covering password validations in this lab, so don't worry
> about those. Password validation is hard to get right anyway â€” it's
> surprisingly easy to produce rules that decrease password security rather than
> enhance it.**

### Task 2: Determine the Design

We need to implement a way for users to sign up, log in, and log out with secure
passwords.

To complete the lab and get the tests passing, you will need to:

- Add methods to the User model to protect and set the password_hash property and
  authenticate a user with their password.

- Create a `Signup` resource with a `post()` method that responds to a
  `POST /signup` request. It should: create a new user; save their hashed
  password in the database; save the user's ID in the session object; and return
  the user object in the JSON response.

- Create a `CheckSession` resource with a `get()` method that responds to a
  `GET /check_session` request. If the user is authenticated, return the user
  object in the JSON response. Otherwise, return an empty response with a 204
  status code.

- Create a `Login` resource with a `post()` method for logging in that
  responds to a `POST /login` request and returns the user as JSON.
  
- Create a `Logout` resource with a `delete()` method for logging out
  that responds to a `DELETE /logout` request.

### Task 3: Develop, Test, and Refine the Code

#### Step 1: Protect the `password_hash` Property

In the User model, add logic to protect the password_property by raising an Exception.

```python
# Build method to protect password_hash property
@hybrid_property
def password_hash(self):
    pass
```

#### Step 2: Use Bcrypt to Hash the Password

In the User model, use `brcypt.generate_password_hash` to set the property.

```python
# Build method to set password hash property using bcrypt.generate_password_hash()
@password_hash.setter
def password_hash(self, password):
    pass
```

#### Step 3: Use Bcrypt to Authenticate a User

In the User model, use `brcypt.check_password_hash` to verify a user's password.

```python
# Build authenticate method that uses bcrypt.check_password_hash()
def authenticate(self, password):
    pass
```

There are no tests for these methods, but you can verify they're set up properly by
using `flask shell` and creating some users.

Once you have all methods created, commit your code.

#### Step 4: Create Signup Endpoint

Create `POST /signup` endpoint. Implement the following:
- Create a new user. 
- Save user to db with their hashed password using bcrypt.
- Log the user in with sessions.
- Return the user object.

Test your logic with `pytest` and commit your code.

#### Step 5: Create Check Session Endpoint

Create `GET /check_session` endpoint. Implement the following:
- If the user is authenticated, return the user object in the JSON response. 
- Else, return an empty response with a 204 status code.

Test your logic with `pytest` and commit your code.

#### Step 6: Create Login Endpoint

Create `POST /login` endpoint. Implement the following:
- Log the user in with sessions.
- Returns the user as JSON.

Test your logic with `pytest` and commit your code.

#### Step 7: Create Logout Endpoint
  
Create `DELETE /logout` endpoint. Implement the following:
- Log the user out with sessions.

Test your logic with `pytest` and commit your code.

#### Step 8: Commit and Push Git History

Once all tests are passing, `git commit` (if needed) and `git push` your final code
to GitHub:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "final solution"
git push
```

If you created a separate feature branch, remember to open a PR on main and merge.

### Task 4: Document and Maintain

Optional Best Practice documentation steps:
* Add comments to the code to explain purpose and logic, clarifying intent and 
functionality of your code to other developers.
* Update README text to reflect the functionality of the application following 
https://makeareadme.com. 
  * Add screenshot of completed work included in Markdown in README.
* Delete any stale branches on GitHub
* Remove unnecessary/commented out code
* If needed, update git ignore to remove sensitive data

## Submit your solution

CodeGrade will use the same test suite as the test suite included.

Once all tests are passing, commit and push your work using `git` to submit to 
CodeGrade through Canvas.
